## Project Understanding:

### Live Football World Cup Scoreboard library: 
- Live Scores.
- Start New Match (Teams Home & Away) -> Default score 0-0.
- Update Score (Receive scores x, y and update Home -> x and Away -> y).
- Finish in progress match (matchInProgress = False) -> Remove from scoreboard.
- Summary of Scores (Sort in place based on total match score).

### Entities
  - **Match**
      - homeTeam
      - awayTeam
      - homeTeamScore
      - awayTeamScore
      - matchInProgress
      - StartMatch()
      - UpdateMatch()
      - finishMatch()
  - **ScoreBoard**
      - matches[]
      - StartMatch()
      - UpdateMatch()
      - finishMatch()
      - matchSummary()


### Assumptions
    1. There is no character limit/specifications for team names.
    2. The team name is case-insensitive.
    3. The matchNumber will be used to sort for teams with same total score during match.
    4. The maximum number of matchs can be 2147483647 (Max limit of an integer match counter).
    5. The solution can be extended or implemented later (Scaleable).
    6. The requirement was to deliver simple draft.
    7. User, who will use this library will manage/install dependecies by its own.

## Overview
Live football world cup scoreboard library is a live matches score updates library. The major requirements of this library design were following:

    1. Start a new match, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard. This should capture following parameters:
        a. Home team
        b. Away team
    2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away team score.
    3. Finish match currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
    4. Get a summary of matches in progress ordered by their total score. The matches with the same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the scoreboard.

This library is design to fulfil these requirement.

### Downloading Library
To execute this reporsitory, you need to download `junit-platform-console-standalone-1.11.3.jar` file and add it to the /lib directory on root of the project. This JAR file can be downloaded from the following link:
`https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.platform/junit-platform-console-standalone/1.11.3`

### Usage
To use this library, you need to follow the steps below:

    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Download the JUnit JAR file from maven repository.
    3. Create `/lib` directory on you root of project and add JAR file into this directory.
    4. Create an instance of `ScoreBoard` class.

        ```JAVA
        ScoreBoardInterface scoreboard = new ScoreBoard();
        ```

    5. To start a match, use the `startMatch(TeamA, TeamB)` method.

        ```JAVA
        scoreboard.startMatch("Germany", "Canada");
        ```

    6. To update score of a match in progress use `updateScore(scoreA, scoreB)` method.

        ```JAVA
        scoreboard.updateScore(2, 3);
        ```
    
    7. To finish a match, use `finishMatch()` method.
    
        ```JAVA
        scoreboard.finishMatch();
        ```
    
    8. To retrieve summary of all matches in progress sort my match total score use `matchesSummary()` method.
    
        ```JAVA
        scoreboard.matchesSummary();
        ```


### Running Unit Tests
There is a test runner class available to run all unit test cases of project through JUnit. Run `TestRunner.java file to execute all test cases and it will show test cases results.
